## 🚨 Risk Management

### High Risks

**Risk**: LLM confidence scores are unreliable
- **Mitigation**: Conservative calibration (0.65x), extensive testing
- **Fallback**: Use simpler heuristics (response length, specificity)

**Risk**: Poor calibration leads to wrong source selection
- **Mitigation**: A/B testing, gradual rollout, easy rollback via feature flag
- **Fallback**: Disable confidence routing, use current system

**Risk**: Performance degradation from additional processing
- **Mitigation**: Caching, parallel processing, performance budgets
- **Fallback**: Optimize thresholds, reduce scoring complexity

### Medium Risks

**Risk**: User confusion about confidence indicators
- **Mitigation**: Clear UI design, user testing, tooltips with explanations
- **Fallback**: Make confidence display optional

**Risk**: Stale Knowledge Base leads to wrong confidence
- **Mitigation**: Time-based decay, regular KB updates, feedback loop
- **Fallback**: Lower confidence for old entries

---

## ✅ Checkpoints & Go/No-Go Decisions

### Checkpoint 1: End of Phase 1 (Week 3)
**Decision**: Is KB confidence scoring accurate?
- ✅ **Go**: Accuracy >75% on test queries
- ❌ **No-Go**: Need to refine scoring formula

### Checkpoint 2: End of Phase 4 (Week 9)
**Decision**: Is orchestration working correctly?
- ✅ **Go**: Routing logic passes all test scenarios
- ❌ **No-Go**: Redesign orchestration strategy

### Checkpoint 3: End of Phase 8 (Week 13)
**Decision**: Is system ready for calibration?
- ✅ **Go**: <5% test failures, no critical bugs
- ❌ **No-Go**: Fix critical issues before proceeding

### Checkpoint 4: End of Phase 9 (Week 14)
**Decision**: Are confidence scores calibrated?
- ✅ **Go**: Calibration error <15%
- ❌ **No-Go**: Collect more data, refine formulas

### Checkpoint 5: Phase 13 (10% rollout)
**Decision**: Roll out to more users?
- ✅ **Go**: Metrics improved, no increase in errors
- ❌ **No-Go**: Roll back, investigate issues

## 🔄 Iteration Strategy

This is an **incremental delivery** approach:

**Week 4**: Basic KB confidence working
**Week 7**: All confidence scorers working
**Week 10**: Full orchestration working (internal only)
**Week 13**: UI complete (internal testing)
**Week 16**: Production deployment

Each phase delivers working functionality that can be tested independently.

## 📝 Notes & Assumptions

### Assumptions
1. Azure OpenAI supports logprobs (validate in Phase 2)
2. Current KB has >100 entries with usage statistics
3. Team has access to staging and production environments
4. Can deploy without downtime using feature flags

### Open Questions
1. What should happen when all sources have <50% confidence?
   - **Current Answer**: Show best result with "low confidence" warning
2. Should we combine multiple sources if confidence is close?
   - **Phase 4 Decision**: Yes, if delta <15%
3. How often should we recalibrate?
   - **Phase 10 Decision**: Automatically every 1000 queries
