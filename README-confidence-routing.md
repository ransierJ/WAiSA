# Confidence-Based Information Source Routing - Executive Summary

## Overview

This is a comprehensive architectural design for a confidence-based information source routing system that intelligently selects the best information source (Knowledge Base, LLM, MS Docs, Web Search) based on confidence scoring and query characteristics.

## Quick Decision Guide

### Which Architecture Pattern?

**✅ RECOMMENDED: Hybrid Orchestrator-Pipeline**

**Why?**
- Flexible enough for multiple routing strategies
- Centralized decision-making for observability
- Easy to extend with new sources
- Supports both sequential and parallel execution

**Alternatives Considered:**
- Pure Pipeline: Too rigid, hard to implement early termination
- Decision Tree: Brittle, requires manual tuning
- Chain of Responsibility: Limited observability

## Routing Strategy Selection

### When to Use Each Strategy

| Strategy | Best For | Latency | Cost | Accuracy |
|----------|----------|---------|------|----------|
| **Sequential Short-Circuit** | Most queries, cost-sensitive | Low | Low | Good |
| **Parallel Aggregate** | Critical queries, accuracy matters | High | High | Best |
| **Parallel Race** | Balanced approach | Medium | Medium | Good |
| **Adaptive** | Production with learning | Variable | Optimized | Best |

### Default Strategy: Sequential Short-Circuit

```
KB (85% threshold) → LLM (75% threshold) → MS Docs (70% threshold) → Web (no threshold)
```

**Reasoning:**
- 80%+ of queries answered by KB or LLM (fast + cheap)
- Progressive fallback ensures answer availability
- Early termination reduces cost and latency
- Typical latency: 100-3500ms for most queries

## Confidence Score Calibration - Key Insights

### The Challenge

Each source has different confidence semantics:
- **KB**: Based on exact matching and freshness
- **LLM**: Based on model uncertainty and hedging language
- **MS Docs**: Based on search relevance and document authority
- **Web**: Based on PageRank and snippet quality

### The Solution: Multi-Factor Calibration

```typescript
Final Confidence = Base Confidence × Feature Adjustments × Historical Accuracy

Example:
KB:  92% × 0.85 (freshness) × 1.1 (multiple docs) × 0.85 (accuracy) = 73%
LLM: 75% × 0.8 (hedging) × 1.2 (citations) × 0.80 (accuracy) = 58%
Result: KB wins with 73% confidence
```

### Critical Thresholds

| Confidence Range | Action | TTL |
|------------------|--------|-----|
| 90-100% | Return immediately, high cache TTL | 24h |
| 80-89% | Return with confidence | 6h |
| 70-79% | Return with alternatives | 2h |
| 60-69% | Return with warning | 1h |
| < 60% | Return with strong warning + alternatives | 30m |

---

## Edge Case Handling - Decision Matrix

| Scenario | Detection | Resolution |
|----------|-----------|------------|
| **All Low Confidence** | All sources < 70% | Return best with warning, show alternatives |
| **Confidence Tie** | Multiple within 5% | Check agreement, combine if agreeing, else show all |
| **Conflicting Answers** | High confidence + low similarity | Apply tie-breakers (recency 30%, authority 40%, specificity 30%) |
| **Source Failures** | Timeout or error | Continue with other sources, return if 1+ succeeds |
| **No Results** | All sources return 0% | Return error with fallback message |

## Performance Optimization - Key Metrics

### Without Optimization
- Average latency: **4500ms**
- P95 latency: **8000ms**
- Cache hit rate: **30%**
- Cost per query: **$0.02**
- Throughput: **50 req/s**

### With Optimization

   - Idle timeout: 30s
   - Acquire timeout: 5s

3. **Adaptive Timeouts**
   - Based on P99 latency × 1.2 buffer
   - Continuously updated from metrics

4. **Request Batching**
   - Group similar queries (100ms window)
   - Single API call for batch

5. **Parallel Execution**
   - Thread pool for concurrent source queries
   - Early termination on high confidence

## Extensibility Design

### Adding a New Source (3 Easy Steps)

**Step 1: Implement Interface**
```typescript
class SlackSearchSource implements InformationSource {
  name = 'slack';
  priority = 2;

  async query(request: QueryRequest): Promise<SourceResult> {
    // Your implementation
  }

  calculateConfidence(result: any): number {
    // Your confidence logic
  }
}
```

**Step 2: Register Source**
```typescript
SourceRegistry.register(new SlackSearchSource());
```

**Step 3: Configure Routing**
```yaml
routing_strategies:
  default:
    sources:
      - name: kb
        threshold: 85
      - name: slack  # New source!
        threshold: 80
      - name: llm
        threshold: 75
```

### Plugin Architecture Benefits
- ✅ No core code changes needed
- ✅ Hot-swappable sources
- ✅ Independent testing
- ✅ Configuration-driven behavior

## Cost Analysis

### Typical Production Costs (250k queries/day)

| Source | Queries | Cost/Query | Daily Cost | Monthly Cost |
|--------|---------|------------|------------|--------------|
| KB | 112,500 (45%) | $0 | $0 | $0 |
| LLM | 87,500 (35%) | $0.01 | $875 | $26,250 |
| MS Docs | 37,500 (15%) | $0.005 | $187.50 | $5,625 |
| Web | 12,500 (5%) | $0.015 | $187.50 | $5,625 |
| **Total** | **250,000** | **$0.005** | **$1,250** | **$37,500** |

### Cost Optimization Strategies

1. **Aggressive Caching** (65% hit rate saves $24,375/month)
2. **KB Enrichment** (Move 10% from LLM to KB saves $7,875/month)
3. **Threshold Tuning** (Raise thresholds by 5% saves ~$5,000/month)
4. **Request Batching** (20% efficiency gain saves $7,500/month)

**Potential Savings: Up to 40% ($15,000/month)**

describe('ConfidenceCalculator', () => {
  test('KB confidence with exact match', () => {
    const result = calculateKBConfidence({ exactMatch: true, freshness: 0.9 });
    expect(result).toBeGreaterThan(80);
  });

  test('LLM confidence with hedging', () => {
    const result = calculateLLMConfidence({

      modelConfidence: 75
    });
    expect(result).toBeLessThan(75); // Reduced due to hedging
  });
});
```

### Integration Tests
```typescript
describe('Orchestrator Integration', () => {
  test('Sequential routing with early termination', async () => {
    const response = await orchestrator.route({ text: "Test query" });
    expect(response.confidence).toBeGreaterThan(70);
    expect(response.source).toBe('kb'); // Should hit KB first
  });

  test('Parallel routing returns best result', async () => {

```javascript
import http from 'k6/http';
import { check, sleep } from 'k6';

export let options = {
  stages: [
    { duration: '2m', target: 100 },  // Ramp up
    { duration: '5m', target: 100 },  // Steady state
    { duration: '2m', target: 200 },  // Spike
    { duration: '2m', target: 0 },    // Ramp down

    http_req_duration: ['p(95)<3000'], // 95% < 3s
  },
};

export default function () {
  let response = http.post('http://api/route', JSON.stringify({
    query: { text: 'How to configure Azure AD?' }
  }));

  check(response, {
    'status is 200': (r) => r.status === 200,
    'has answer': (r) => JSON.parse(r.body).answer.length > 0,
    'has confidence': (r) => JSON.parse(r.body).confidence > 0,
  });

  sleep(1);
}
```

## FAQs

### Q: Should we query sources sequentially or in parallel?

**A:** **It depends on the use case:**

- **Sequential Short-Circuit** (default): Best for most queries where latency and cost matter. 80%+ of queries will be answered by KB or LLM within 1-3 seconds.

- **Parallel Aggregate**: Use for critical queries where getting the best possible answer matters more than latency/cost. Adds 2-3 seconds but ensures highest accuracy.

- **Adaptive**: Use in production with sufficient traffic to learn patterns. Will automatically choose the best strategy based on historical data.

### Q: How do we calibrate confidence scores across different sources?

**A:** Use a **multi-factor approach**:

1. **Source-specific base confidence** (match quality, relevance, etc.)
2. **Feature adjustments** (freshness, citations, length, hedging)
3. **Historical accuracy factor** (from user feedback over time)

```
Final = Base × Features × Historical
```

This normalizes scores so "80% from KB" means the same thing as "80% from LLM."

### Q: What if all sources return low confidence?

**A:** Follow this hierarchy:

1. **Return best available** with strong warning
2. **Show all alternatives** so user can judge
3. **Suggest verification** from external sources
4. **Suggest human expert** for critical queries
5. **Log for analysis** to improve sources

Never return "no answer" - always return something with appropriate warnings.

### Q: How do we handle conflicting high-confidence answers?

**A:** Apply **tie-breaker rules**:

1. **Recency** (30% weight): Prefer more recent information
2. **Authority** (40% weight): Prefer more authoritative sources (KB > MS Docs > LLM > Web)
3. **Specificity** (30% weight): Prefer more detailed, specific answers

Then **reduce confidence by 10%** to reflect the conflict and show alternatives.

### Q: How can we make this extensible?

**A:** Use a **plugin architecture**:

- Sources implement `InformationSource` interface
- Register via `SourceRegistry.register()`
- Configure thresholds in YAML
- No core code changes needed

New sources can be added in < 1 day of development.

### Q: What's the expected latency in production?

**A:** With optimizations:

- **Best case** (cache hit): 1-5ms
- **Good case** (KB hit): 100-500ms
- **Normal case** (LLM hit): 1500-3500ms
- **Worst case** (all sources): 5000-10000ms

**P95 latency target: < 2500ms**

### Q: How much will this cost?

**A:** Assuming 250k queries/day:

- **Without caching**: $50,000/month
- **With 65% cache hit rate**: $37,500/month
- **With optimizations**: ~$25,000/month

**Cost per query: $0.005 (half a cent)**

Most cost is from LLM API calls. Every 10% of queries moved from LLM to KB saves ~$2,600/month.
